You were seen in the emergency department and found to have a miscarriage (also called early pregnancy loss).  We decided to use a medication called misopristol to help with the symptoms of your miscarriage.

You were given a prescription for misoprostol, please use as indicated below:
•	Take your 1st dose of misoprostol (in ED or at home)- take ibuprofen to help with side effects. Take 800 mcg (4 tabs) of misoprostol and place in your cheek or under your tongue. Hold there for 30 minutes to help dissolve. Then swallow the pills with a drink.
•	Monitor your symptoms - bleeding and cramping should start or increase within 2-4 hours. This will be heavier than a period and should last 3-5 hours. It should lighten but may continue off and on for 1-2 weeks. For pain - You can use ibuprofen or hot packs to your pelvis. You can use ondansetron for nausea
•	Consider an extra dose of misoprostol at 8 hours - if bleeding or cramping have not started after 1st dose OR bleeding is still heavy after 8 hours, consider taking a 2nd dose. Can repeat up to 3 doses in 24-48 hours.

 You should consider following up with your primary doctor or OB/Gyn to make sure things have completed. You may continue to have intermittent bleeding/cramping for 1-2 weeks. You can check a home pregnancy test which should be negative by 5 weeks. You should DEFINITELY see your doctor and may need a follow-up procedure if:
•	Your pregnancy symptoms last longer than a week
•	Your home pregnancy test remains positive after 5 weeks

Please return to the emergency department for signs you could be having a complication like:
•	Heavy bleeding where you are soaking 2 or more maxipads an hour for 2 or more hours not improving with misoprisotol
•	If you have foul smelling discharge or Fever >101.0 F
•	Pain or vomiting not controlled with medication
•	Feeling very upset or thoughts of wanting to harm yourself

It is ok to have feelings of grief or sadness after an early pregnancy loss. Please understand that nothing you did caused the pregnancy loss. It is not caused by stress, sports, food or sex. If you feel very upset, talk to your doctor and get the help you need.
