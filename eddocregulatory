Emergency Department Fluid Administration
@OTHERNOTESBEGIN@
Today, based on my clinical judgement, I believe the patient required rapid parenteral fluid treatment while in the emergency department and that oral hydration was not indicated. The decision to give IV fluids was based in part on the following:

Sepsis Decision Making
@OTHERNOTESBEGIN@
SIRS	Sepsis	Severe Sepsis	Septic Shock
T>38.3 or <36	Infection	Lactate >2	Lactate > 4
HR > 90	+	Single SBP < 90	SBP <90 despite IVFs
RR >20	2 SIRS	BiPAP/Vent
WBC > 12 or <4;
Bands > 10%		Cr or Bili >2, INR > 1.5, Plts < 100k

Sepsis Recognition Time:
{edsldocsepsistimestart (Optional):26944}

Delays:
[ ] Waiting for blood cultures to be drawn would have resulted in a delay of >45 minutes in starting antibiotics.
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused IV placement and blood draw (blood cultures, lactic acid).
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused antibiotics.
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused vasopressors.

COVID-19 Pandemic
@OTHERNOTESBEGIN@
This patient was evaluated for the symptoms described in the history of present illness. They were evaluated in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated consideration that the patient might be at risk for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Institutional protocols and algorithms that pertain to the evaluation of patients at risk for COVID-19 are in a state of rapid change based on information released by regulatory bodies including the CDC and federal and state organizations. These policies and algorithms were followed during the patient's care.
