Emergency Department Fluid Administration

Today, based on my clinical judgement, I believe the patient required rapid parenteral fluid treatment while in the emergency department and that oral hydration was not indicated. The decision to give IV fluids was based in part on the following: {edsldocivf (Optional):26940}
          

Sepsis Decision Making

SIRS	Sepsis	Severe Sepsis	Septic Shock
T>38.3 or <36	Infection	Lactate >2	Lactate = 4
HR > 90	+	Single SBP < 90	SBP <90 despite IVFs
RR >20	2 SIRS	BiPAP/Vent	
WBC > 12 or <4;
Bands > 10%		Cr or Bili >2, INR > 1.5, Plts < 100k	

Sepsis Recognition Time:
{edsldocsepsistimestart (Optional):26944}

Delays:
[ ] Waiting for blood cultures to be drawn would have resulted in a delay of >45 minutes in starting antibiotics.
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused IV placement and blood draw (blood cultures, lactic acid). 
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused antibiotics. 
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused vasopressors.

Resuscitation Volume:
Check One	 Weight Range 
Actual Wt or IBW	30 mL/kg Resuscitation Volumes	OR	Check One	Lesser Resuscitation Volumes
 [ ] 	Exact Weight	30 mL/kg		 [ ] 	500 mL
 [ ] 	<50 kg	1500 mL		 [ ] 	1000 mL
 [ ] 	50-67 kg	2000 mL		 [ ] 	1500 mL
 [ ] 	67-83 kg	2500 mL		 [ ] 	2000 mL
 [ ] 	83-100 kg	3000 mL			
 [ ] 	>100 kg	Recommend IBW
