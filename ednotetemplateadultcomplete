O2 Saturation Interpretation
The oxygen saturation is @FLOW(10:FIRST)@ [@FLOW(301030:First)@], which is ***normal per my interpretation.

The oxygen saturation is @FLOW(10:FIRST)@ [@FLOW(301030:First)@], which is {Desc; adequate/inadequate:30688:o} per my interpretation.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Emergency Department Fluid Administration
@OTHERNOTESBEGIN@
Today, based on my clinical judgement, I believe the patient required rapid parenteral fluid treatment while in the emergency department and that oral hydration was not indicated. The decision to give IV fluids was based in part on the following:

[ ] Not applicable, IV fluids were not administered during this ED encounter.
[ ] [VS] Abnormal vital signs (fever, tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, etc).
[ ] [LABS] Laboratory abnormality (elevated glucose, BUN/Cr, Lactate, CK, Na, etc).
[ ] [NPO] Known or potential need for surgery/procedure, aspiration risk, or other contraindication to oral hydration.
[ ] [AMS] Confusion or dementia and not able to reliably follow direction to proceed with oral hydration.
[ ] [CONTRAST] Hydration to reduce risk of contrast induced nephropathy.
[ ] [SEPSIS] Sepsis treatment-see below.
[ ] [DEHYDRATION] Clinical signs of dehydration (dry membranes, poor skin turgor, etc).
[ ] [ONGOING LOSSES] Ongoing volume voss (vomiting/diarrhea, burns, or other excessive losses).
[ ] [SEVERE NAUSEA]Ongoing severe nausea and not tolerating oral hydration.
[ ] [OTHER] Fluids ordered for other reasons (decision based on other clinical factors).

Sepsis Decision Making
@OTHERNOTESBEGIN@
Sepsis Recognition Time:
Severe sepsis or septic shock criteria were met at ***

Delays:
[ ] Waiting for blood cultures to be drawn would have resulted in a delay of >45 minutes in starting antibiotics.
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused IV placement and blood draw (blood cultures, lactic acid).
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused antibiotics.
[ ] After a risk/benefit discussion the patient/POA refused vasopressors.

COVID-19 Pandemic
@OTHERNOTESBEGIN@
This patient was evaluated for the symptoms described in the history of present illness. They were evaluated in the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated consideration that the patient might be at risk for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Institutional protocols and algorithms that pertain to the evaluation of patients at risk for COVID-19 are in a state of rapid change based on information released by regulatory bodies including the CDC and federal and state organizations. These policies and algorithms were followed during the patient's care.
