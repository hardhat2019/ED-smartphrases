[NA] Septic Shock not present

[30 mL/Kg] The patient was volume resuscitated with 30 mL/kg based on measured weight.

[IBW] The patient has a BMI >30 and was volume resuscitated with 30 mL/kg based on IBW.

[Less: Responded] crystalloid fluids (see above for volume) were given in lieu of a 30 cc/kg bolus because the blood pressure responded to a lesser volume.

[Less: Volume Overload] crystalloid fluids (see above for volume) were given in lieu of a 30 cc/kg bolus because the clinician has concern for volume overload.

[Less: Heart Failure] crystalloid fluids (see above for volume) were given in lieu of a 30 cc/kg bolus because the clinician has concern for heart failure.

[Less: Renal Failure] crystalloid fluids (see above for volume) were given in lieu of a 30 cc/kg bolus because the clinician has concern for renal failure.

[Refused] The patient/surrogate decision maker refused 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation after a risk/benefit discussion.

[Covid] The patient has or is suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and thus was not resuscitated with 30 mL/kg of fluid.
